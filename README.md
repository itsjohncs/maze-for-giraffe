# Labyrinthus Ob Camelopardum (Maze for Giraffe)

This is a game I made in High School in order to fulfill a quarter-long project my Latin program always held called Magis (which means *more* in English). The game is filled with inside jokes and silly puns, and is one of my last large Visual Basic 6 applications. I had already begun working as a contractor and was making the switch to C#, C++, and C.

It was a lot of fun to make, and I think the finished product flows fairly well.

I will be making a video walkthrough of this soon and sprucing it up so that I can put it on my [portfolio](http://johnsullivan.name). Stay tuned.
